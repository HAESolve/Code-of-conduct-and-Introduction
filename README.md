# Code-of-conduct-and-Introduction
HAESolve is a project based on solving the sdg problems with ai and ml. the word HAES means health,agriculture,enivironment,education and sound and olve comes from solve which is solving the problems. we are a small team of futuristic people trying to just not escape but look face to face at the problems and solve it , in short we are a group of problem solvers trying to protect the mother nature. we have the technology so why not use it and do some good for the future generations. Lets do some good.

#Be a HAESolvian be a protector
#Health
we are planning to automate the whole process of predicting a disease, automating the process of buying medicine and telling a person what to do to get better and have a cure as fast as possible. The contact number of  doctor and hospitals near by from google maps. This is our  plan as of now.  we have planned for a back up that is that if a person is unable to say his/her problem or the person can click a picture or write a text. 
#Mental Health
we are trying to do some diagnostic tests of the user, that is the EEG, ECG and EMG and predict the health of the user. we will either click a picture of the chart or ask the person questions. 
#Agriculture
Farmers have to fight out a lot of things like :-

* seed failure 

* crop failure

* problems with soil testing

* production prediction

* they get cheated in the market due to lack of education 

* climate changes 

we are trying to speed up the soil test, check for crop fertility, predict production and sale in the area, show them what can be grown more effectively on the piece of land ? , seed testing and  many more.

But still there is a proverb "Don't teach fish to swim and farmer to grow crops ."
#Education
There are more than 10 crore kids in India, more than a 2 lakh school that have only 1-2 teachers, there are schools with no class room, no bath room, there are schools with no teacher. now-a-days there is no digital divide only content divide, and we have to fight it. there is a quote :-

To become educated properly you need nothing a passionate teacher, a greedy for knowledge student, a pen, a paper. The world is your canvas and you can change everything.

list of problems because of lack of education

* people  get cheated

* poor health

* lack of  voice

* lack of intelligence

* short life span

* people become prey to raicism in society

* people are unaware of the rights and duties 

* powerful people  and politicians buying votes by be-fooling uneducated people, there fore causing harm to the nation 

* wastage of natural resources

* decrease in economic growth of the country

* increase of labour classes

* decrease in population

* increase in child labour and child marriages 

* increase in unemployment

* increase in death due to starvation and depression

* raise of people believing and practicing occult practices and rituals

* spread of rumors  and list will go on forever....

# Ways in which HAESolve is trying to fight

smart education by providing smarter content

Simplifying Administrative Tasks

 Personalized Learning

Global Learning

New Efficiencies

how ?

Education has no limits, and AI can help to eliminate boundaries. Technology brings drastic transitions by facilitating the learning of any course from anywhere across the globe and at any time. AI-powered education equips students with fundamental IT skills. With more inventions, there will be a wider range of courses available online and with the help of AI, students will be learning from wherever they are.  Providing smarter and smarter content, there fore breaking content divide. Taking it global, making the education system at a next level.

#Environment 


environment pollution, garbages, bio-degradable and non-bio-degradables, sudden climate changes and many more reasons.

here is a list from Wikipedia :--

Human overpopulation — Biocapacity climate change • Carrying capacity • Exploitation • Industrialisation • I = PAT • Land degradation • Land reclamation • Optimum population • Overshoot (population) • Population density • Population dynamics • Population growth • Projections of population growth • Total fertility rate • Urbanization • Waste • Water conflict • Water scarcity • Overdrafting

Hydrology — Environmental impacts of reservoirs • Tile drainage • Hydrology (agriculture) • Flooding • Landslide

Intensive farming — Agricultural subsidy • Environmental effects of meat production • Intensive animal farming • Intensive crop farming • Irrigation • Monoculture • Nutrient pollution • Overgrazing • Pesticide drift • Plasticulture • Slash and burn • Tile drainage

Land use — Built environment • Desertification • Habitat fragmentation • Habitat destruction • Land degradation • Land pollution • Lawn-environmental concerns • Trail ethics • Urban heat island • Urban sprawl

Nanotechnology — Impact of nanotechnology

Natural disasters

Nuclear issues — Nuclear fallout • Nuclear meltdown • Nuclear power • Nuclear weapons • Nuclear and radiation accidents • Nuclear safety • High-level radioactive waste management

Ocean trash • Garbage Patch • Ghost net • Washed Ashore

Water Pollution

Air pollution

land pollution 

sound pollution (will discuss about in sound sector)

we will do the following :-

AI used for energy 

Making cities more livable and sustainable 

Smart agriculture (part of the agriculture sector)

Protecting the oceans 

Better climate predictions  (part of the agriculture sector)

How AI is used for energy ?

AI is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well.

Making cities more livable and sustainable, how ?

AI can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the Internet of Things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data) to forecast energy demand. In addition, artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness. One vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability, traffic and weather to make cities more energy efficient and livable.

Smart agriculture, sound amaging right let me assure it's true  and how it will all work?

Hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well.

Data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture, soil composition and temperature help AI improve production and know when crops need watering. Incorporating this information with that from drones, which are also used to monitor conditions, can help increasingly automatic AI systems know the best times to plant, spray and harvest crops, and when to head off diseases and other problems. This will result in increased efficiency, enhanced yields, and lower use of water, fertilizer and pesticides.

Protecting the oceans , how ?

The Ocean Data Alliance is working with machine learning to provide data from satellites and ocean exploration so that decision-makers can monitor shipping, ocean mining, fishing, coral bleaching or the outbreak of a marine disease. With almost real time data, decision-makers and authorities will be able to respond to problems more quickly. Artificial intelligence can also help predict the spread of invasive species, follow marine litter, monitor ocean currents, keep track of dead zones and measure pollution levels. 

Better climate predictions , you guessed it right ?

As the climate changes, accurate projections are increasingly important. However, climate models often produce very different predictions, largely because of how data is broken down into discrete parts, how processes and systems are paired, and because of the large variety of spatial and temporal scales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports are based on many climate models and show the range of predictions, which are then averaged out.

Averaging them out, however, means that each climate model is given equal weight. AI is helping to determine which models are more reliable by giving added weight to those whose predictions eventually prove to be more accurate, and less weight to those performing poorly. This will help improve the accuracy of climate change projections.

AI and deep learning are also improving weather forecasting and the prediction of extreme events. That’s because they can incorporate much more of the real-world complexity of the climate system, such as atmospheric and ocean dynamics and ocean and atmospheric chemistry, into their calculations. This sharpens the precision of weather and climate modeling, making simulations more useful for decision-makers.
